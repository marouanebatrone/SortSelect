# SortSelect

SortSelect is a Java-based sorting algorithm selection tool that assists you in choosing the most efficient sorting algorithm for a given data input. 
It uses benchmarking and analysis to automatically select the optimal sorting method, ensuring your data is sorted as efficiently as possible.

# Features

Automatic Algorithm Selection: SortSelect analyzes your data input and chooses the best sorting algorithm for optimal performance.
Benchmarking: Evaluate the efficiency of different sorting algorithms and identify the most suitable one for your data.
User-Friendly: A simple and intuitive interface for inputting your data and generating sorted results.
Flexible: Easily extendable to support additional sorting algorithms in the future.

# Usage

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sortselect.git
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Build the project to generate the executable JAR file.
4. Compile and run the project using your Java IDE or execute the JAR file.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the size of the array and input the array elements.
6. SortSelect will automatically select the most efficient sorting algorithm based on benchmarking and display the sorted result.
